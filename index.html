        <p> Hi my name is Maya Watanabe and I am a student currently attending Occidental College  in LA. I was born in Tokyo before moving to Maui at age four. I play the bass guitar and love creating Art. Right now, I am an intern at artworxLA where I help with the Advanced Programming Art Workshops for high school students.  </p>
